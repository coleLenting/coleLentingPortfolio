                    <p>Work Integrated Learning
                        As part of my Work Integrated Learning, I collaborated with WoodWise Furniture, a bespoke woodwork brand, to design and develop a clean, minimalist website that accurately reflected the craftsmanship and authenticity of their products. The project involved close communication with the client to understand their brand identity, aesthetic preferences, and functional requirements. I focused on creating an intuitive user experience with a layout that highlighted their handcrafted furniture pieces while maintaining modern responsiveness across devices. From structuring the gallery to organizing content with thoughtful typography and whitespace, every design decision was made to align with WoodWise Furniture’s vision. Additionally, I ensured that the site was SEO-friendly and easy to maintain, setting up the foundation for future scalability. The final result was a visually cohesive, user-friendly platform that reinforced the brand’s values and enhanced its online presence.
